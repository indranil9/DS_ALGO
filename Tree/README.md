#Tree

A tree structure or tree diagram is a way of representing the hierarchical nature of a structure in a graphical form. It is named a "tree 

structure" because the classic representation resembles a tree, even though the chart is generally upside down compared to a biological tree, with 

the "stem" at the top and the "leaves" at the bottom.


A tree structure is conceptual, and appears in several forms. For a discussion of tree structures in specific fields, see Tree (data structure) for 

computer science: insofar as it relates to graph theory, see tree (graph theory), or also tree (set theory). Other related articles are listed.
